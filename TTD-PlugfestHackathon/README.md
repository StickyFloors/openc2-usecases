# 1 - Intro

There is no better time
to be in the cyber-security profession than today.
We are faced with interesting problems
and we address the needs of new functionality
within evolving cyber-ecosystems.  
We are seeing an expansion in the
cyber-physical (such as robotics and self driving cars)
and an increase in the abstract (such as cloud migration,
artificial intelligence and machine learning).  
Cyber-security is a most rewarding profession to be in,
but there are associated challenges.  
We need the experts to be able
to focus their efforts and permit their innovations
to be applied to a range of uses regardless of the cyber-ecosystem.

This is where efforts such as
OpenC2, SBOM, IACD, OCA, SCAPv2 come in.  
The OpenC2 Plugfest/SBOM PoC/Hackathon
is a mashup of combining all these concepts
to demonstrate usecases showing the value of automated defense.  

OpenC2 is a standardized language
for the command and control of technologies
that provide or support cyber defenses.
By providing a common language for
machine-to-machine communication,
OpenC2 is vendor and application agnostic,
enabling interoperability across a range of cyber security tools
and applications.
The use of standardized interfaces and protocols enables
interoperability of different tools,
regardless of the vendor that developed them,
the programming language they are written in
or the function they are designed to fulfill.
OpenC2 has an initial suite of specifications written
and we are at the point where we are applying it to
real world use cases on real cyber security products.   

OpenC2 organized a Plug Fest that was to take place
in conjunction with
[Technology Transfer Days](https://techtransferdays.org/).  
The Plug Fest was intended to encourage participation
beyond the individuals from 39 different organizations
that are on the OpenC2 effort within OASIS,
and to include the larger ecosystems
OpenC2 operates in (IACD, OCAS, SCAPv2, OCA, â€¦).

The physical OpenC2 plugfest was cancelled
when TechTransferDays (TTD see https://techtransferdays.org/)
was cancelled due to the pandemic.
It is being replaced with a virtual Meetup on October 28th.
More details will be published here as they are determined.
The details will be worked out as part of the SBOM-PoC.
See [SBOM Proof of Concept](../SBOM-PoC/)
for details on the work leading up to the plugfest..

SBOM-PoC will be used as the shortened version of the
SBOM/SCAPv2/IACD/OCA/CACAO/...
virtual PoC/plugfest/hackathon
that is occurring up until 27-Oct.
Plugfest will be shorthand for the
SBOM/SCAPv2/IACD/OCA/CACAO/...
virtual PoC/plugfest/hackathon
event on Oct 28th
but realistically it will probable get called SBOM-PoC as well.

For organizations participating, see

# 2 - SBOM Proof of Concept
See [SBOM Proof of Concept](../SBOM-PoC/)
for the virtual plugfest/hackathon/proof-of-concept leading up to physically getting together in NYC at TTD. This PoC is a virtual meetup-mashup of it's own of several different efforts.

# 3 - Meetup Logistics
This section will get more detail
closer to the event.

# 4 - Meetup Prep
This section will get more detail
closer to the event.
For now, see [SBOM Proof of Concept](#sbom-proof-of-concept)
which is the virtual plugfest/hackathon/proof-of-concept
leading up to the October 28th meetup.
