## 2. Opening Plenary & Session 3 Tutorials
brief summary from each org that
brought something to workshop
on what they got out of it
### 2.1 OpenC2
[This video](https://youtu.be/O78Qx_6PK9s)
was presented in the opening plenary.

someone draft more blahblah here
for value OpenC2 got out of the
day (and prep for the day)
### 2.2 SBOM
### 2.3 IACD
### 2.4 SCAPv2
### 2.6 OCA
### 2.7 CACAO
Portions of
[this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hi6vXKc_9ZE)
were shown in the opening plenary
to explain CACAO playbooks
and the rationale for using them.

The workshop proved the concept that
CACAO playbooks could be used for
plugfest scenarios.
A playbook was livecoded during a breakout session.

Enriching IPv4 IOC:
demonstrated one simple use case
where a CACAO Playbook
integrates an OpenC2 command
for retrieving the autonomous system number
for an IPv4 address.

### 2.18 Hereuco
Hereuco presented
[this video](https://youtu.be/q4p5-k2ZUX4)
in the opening plenary
as well as gave an in-depth tutorial
in Breakout Session 3.
HereUco LLC presented an open source OpenC2
file querying producer and consumer tool
to test multi-vendor interoperability.
Their openc2 tool is primarily focused
on helping others test interoperability
and to generate sample OpenC2 commands.
They found the event extremely rewarding as
HereUco gathered a lot of input on their OpenC2
implementation.
HereUco was gracious enough to create a cloud
instance of their tool so that other attendees
could test their https OpenC2 implementations.
A couple of companies commented that they were
able to test against the cloud OpenC2 listening
instance and were successful in inter openc2
system communications.
HereUco was represented by Efrain Ortiz. He said,
"I really enjoyed talking and coding for the other
participants,
recoding live to get multiple vendor
internetworking was a great exercise. Learned more
in a few hours than I could have accomplished in a
week.
I'm looking forward to the next one." HereUco
published their code at
