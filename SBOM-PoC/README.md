# 1 - Intro
This SBOM PoC is (at least conceptually in Duncan's head) a combination of several efforts:
- OpenC2 virtual plugfest/hackathon in preparation for [TTD-PlugfestHackathon](../TTD-PlugfestHackathon/)
- NTIA SBOM Transfer PoC - see [here](https://www.ntia.gov/sbom) and [here](https://www.ntia.gov/SoftwareTransparency)
- others TBD including potentially
   - [Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense or IACD](https://www.iacdautomate.org/) SOAR PoC showing playbooks and automated orchestration
  - [CACAO](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cacao) playbook PoC
  - [Open Cybersecurity Alliance](https://opencybersecurityalliance.org/) PoC

See [Section 3](#3-goals-and-objectives)
for goals and objectives of each of these.
