- NTIA SBOM Transfer PoC - see [here](https://www.ntia.gov/sbom) and [here](https://www.ntia.gov/SoftwareTransparency)
- others TBD including potentially
   - [Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense or IACD](https://www.iacdautomate.org/) SOAR PoC showing playbooks and automated orchestration
  - [CACAO](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/tc_home.php?wg_abbrev=cacao) playbook PoC
