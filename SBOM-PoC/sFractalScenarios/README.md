## 1 - Intro
The Software Bill Of Materials (SBOM) Proof of Concept (PoC)
sets out to prove several concepts e.g.
- SBOMs
   - may be used in protecting organizational systems, networks, data, and users
   - may be created
   - may be obtained
   - may be used to make security decisions
- Openc2
   - may be used in protecting organizational systems, networks, data, and users
   - may be used to obtain SBOMs
   - may be used to command and control security functions
- CACAO playbooks
   - may be used in protecting organizational systems, networks, data, and users
   - may be used to identify, create, document, and test detection, investigation, prevention, mitigation, and remediation steps

## 2 - Scenario Planning
Scenario planning is not correct name for this Section

blah blah on how each scenario is it's own subdirectory and
consists of a text explanation in the README,
a diagram showing the flow,
one or more CACAO playbooks of the flow,
and a page documenting either the plan, the status, and/or the results
depending on what has been done.
Playbooks may reference playbooks in other scenarios.

blah blah on the big picture (maybe some of the megascenarios?) and
a heirarchical list of the scenarios sFractal intends to be involved in
(maybe this belongs up a level and is for everybody's scenarios?)
