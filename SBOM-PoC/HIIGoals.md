## 2-Goals & Objectives

### 2.1-OpenC2 Virtual Plugfest/Hackathon Goals & Objectives

A series of virtual plugfest use cases to demonstrate interoperability showcasing the OpenC2 language.  These use cases will demonstrate the capability of the OpenC2 Integration Framework (OIF) to send OpenC2 commands and receive OpenC2 responses using the HTTPS, MQTT and HTTP transport mechanisms.  OIF will use JSON schemas generated by the JSON Abstract Data Notation (JADN) Schema Generator. The OIF will demonstrate the following interworking capabilities: 

1. OIF Orchestrator interworks to a Single External Plugfest Actuator
2. OIF Orchestrator interworks to Multiple External Plugfest Actuators
3. OIF Orchestrator interworks to a Single Yuuki Actuator
4. OIF Orchestrator interworks to Multiple Yuuki Actuators
5. OIF Orchestrator interworks to a Single OIF Actuators 
6. OIF Orchestrator interworks to Multiple OIF Actuators 
7. Specific External Plugfest Actuator Blinky HaHa to receive OpenC2 commands from OIF.
8. OIF retrieves Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from Blinky HaHa.
9. OIF sends OpenC2 command to Blinky HaHa using a Raspberry Pi Zero card.
10. OIF sends OpenC2 command to Blinky HaHa using a Raspberry Pi 4 card.
11. OIF Orchestrator commanding multiple OIF Devices in a virtual networking setup on one machine
12. OIF Orchestrator commanding multiple OIF Devices in a physical networking setup on multiple machines
13. OIF Orchestrator commanding our Blinky Light Board and a Blinky HaHa in a physical networking setup within HII. 
14. OIF Orchestrator commanding a Blinky HaHa on LAN network over the Internet.
15. Specific External Plugfest Actuator Blinky MaHa to receive OpenC2 commands from OIF.
16. OIF retrieves SBOM from Blinky MaHa. 
17. OIF sends OpenC2 command to Blinky MaHa Using a Raspberry Pi Zero card.
18. OIF sends OpenC2 command to Blinky MaHa Using a Raspberry Pi 4 card.
19. OIF Orchestrator commanding our Blinky Light Board and a Blinky MaHa in a physical networking setup within HII.
20. OIF Orchestrator commanding a Blinky MaHa on LAN network over the Internet.
21. Implementation of a compact, binary serialization *(e.g., CBOR, Protobuf)"

### 2.2-NTIA SBOM Exchange PoC Goals & Objectives

1. OIF retrieves Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from Blinky HaHa.
2. OIF retrieves Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from Blinky MaHa.
3. Using both "good" and "vulnerable" SBOMs, show the value of the SBOM by using the OIF orchestrator
to 'connect' the 'good' Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) while "fixing" or "sandboxing" the vulnerable OpenC2 devices with the vulnerable SBOM.



### 2.3-IACD Goals & Objectives

Integrated Adaptive Cyber Defense (IACD) is a strategy and framework to adopt an vendor-agnostic, extensible, adaptive, commercial off-the-shelf (COTS)-based approach to cybersecurity operations. IACD's goal is to dramatically change the timeline and effectiveness of cyber defense via integration, automation, orchestration and sharing of machine-readable cyber threat information.  

Many of the OpenC2 goals are consistent with IACD goals.  The IACD has technical communities which work together for the development of Protection Profiles for Security Orchestration, Automation, and Response (SOAR) Applications.  There is an OpenC2 Actuator Profile subcommittee that is creating and maintaining actuator profiles which define the OpenC2 message elements applicable to specific cyber defense functions.  

1.  OpenC2 actuator profiles will be created to perform specific cyber defense functions.
2.  OpenC2 actuator profiles will be exercised to perform specific cyber defense functions.



### 2.4-CACAO Goals & Objectives

Collaborative Automated Course of Action Operations (CACAO) is a specification for implementing course-of-action playbooks for cybersecurity operations. Ideally CACAO would be used for the security policy driving the decision making in the automated response to the SBOM as part of the PoC. Goals for CACAO would include:

1. OIF retrieves Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from Blinky HaHa and the OIF orchestrator exercises a course of action consisting of a sequence of OpenC2 commands based on the content of the retrieved SBOM. 
2. OIF retrieves Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from Blinky MaHa and the OIF orchestrator exercises a course of action consisting of a sequence of OpenC2 commands based on the content of the retrieved SBOM.


### 2.5-Open Cybersecurity Alliance Goals & Objectives

The Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA) Project is comprised of global like-minded cybersecurity vendors, end users, thought leaders and individuals who are interested in fostering an open cybersecurity ecosystem, where products from all vendors and software publishers can freely exchange information, insights, analytics, and orchestrated response, via commonly developed code and tooling, using mutually agreed upon technologies, data standards, and procedures.  The Open Cybersecurity Alliance (OCA) is an open cybersecurity ecosystem for vendor-agnostic interworking and data sharing using open standards like STIX and OpenC2.  The OCA project will make use of the OpenC2 standard to communicate with endpoint devices for automated remediation activities. 

1. OIF retrieves Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from endpoint device called Blinky HaHa provided by OCA Sponsor SFractal Consulting LLC.  The OIF orchestrator exercises a remedial sequence of OpenC2 commands based on the content of the retrieved SBOM. 
2. OIF retrieves Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from endpoint device called Blinky MaHa provided by OCA Sponsor SFractal Consulting LLC. The OIF orchestrator exercises a remedial sequence of OpenC2 commands based on the content of the retrieved SBOM.
3. OIF retrieves Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) from an endpoint device provided by another OCA sponsor.  The OIF orchestrator exercises sequence of OpenC2 commands based on the content of the retrieved SBOM. 



## 3-HII Contributions to PoC

1.  OIF orchestrator and OIF actuators provided to other virtual plugfest participants as test devices for interworking using OpenC2.
2.  OIF interworking with Blinky HaHa and Blinky MaHa with SBOMs with scenarios - one-hop, complete, and various 'vulnerable' SBOMs to drive different behaviour by OIF orchestrator.
3.  Providing schemas generated by the schema generator to virtual plugfest participants to enable them to interwork with other virtual plugfest participants.
4.  Yuuki actuators provided to other virtual plugfest participants as test devices for interworking using OpenC2.
