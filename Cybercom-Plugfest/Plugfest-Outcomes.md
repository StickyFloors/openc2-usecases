# Projects / BoF Groups

If writing up a project, please capture the initial (start of plug fest) and final (end of plug fest) state of your project, so that we have some indication of progress made during the event.

## Project: OpenC2 Schema Tools
*Description:* GCP-based schema processor with a REST API and a web front end.  This is a "meta-project" intended
to support project development during and after the plugfest.

## Project: HaHa Actuator on Raspberry Pi (sFractal Consulting)

*Description:* This project is based on the HaHa elixir open
source code. See https://github.com/oasis-open/openc2-lycan-beam/tree/master/haha/elixir.
Several aspects:
* HaHa/SBOM/Blinky actuator running on laptop
* Blinky running on Raspberry Pi Zero
* Blinky running on Raspberry Pi 4

*State:*

* State before plugfest
  + openc2 haha/sbom/blink server running on laptop on HTTP (not OC2-compliant HTTPS)
  + blinky running on raspberry pi's - but not yet OpenC2 controlled
* State at end of plugfest
  + HTTPS was added - alot of issues with certs, headers, and stuff that really wasn't OC2 but impeded
  + other people accessed HaHa & SBOM using postman. Accessing from HII OIF did not work due to header issues. Accessing from NineFX code worked if all the cert checks were disabled
* Everything used was open source
* Demonstrated - yes
* Interworked:
  + Yes via HTTP (non-compliant with OC2 Transport Spec) using Postman
  + Yes via HTTPS using postman (probably not OC2-compliant, not clear on header issues)
  + Sort of Yes from NineFX code (custom response header issues on sFractal side)
  + No from HII OIF

## Project: Dynamic Recognition of Actuator Capabilities (UK Mod / CACI UK)

A demo application for connecting to actuators during the event. Our use case is to provide a theoretical user a GUI which allows them to execute a course of action. The application automatically populates the actuator's capabilities, and then builds and executes an OpenC2 request. We used query features to get the profile and then built the profile up via the GUI as form elements.

We will explore whether it is possible to share further work on actuator auto-discovery using MDNS and MANET data distribution protocols. 

*State:*
* State before plugfest
  + Incomplete implementation for discovering actuators and executing actions
* State at end of plugfest
  + Still not complete but much closer, could discover actuators, configure a profile and then execute actions against a target using 3rd party actuators
* Not open sourced but will be soon.
* Demonstrated - yes (slides)
* Interworked:
  + Yes via HTTP to 3 actuators (Bluevector, Denver Airport Demo and Blinking Lights)

*Source*:  Firewall / Packet Filtering BoF

*Potential Solutions*: suggestions for resolutions or work-arounds developed

## Issue 11: Content Balance Between HTTPS Headers and OpenC2 Message Content

*Source*:  Multiple groups.

*Description:* PF participants had numerous interworking issues relating to informtion in HTTP headers vs. OpenC2 message content.

*Potential Solutions*: revisit the decisions made for the v1.0  HTTPS specification for such information elements as the CommandID, content type, etc., based on results of plug fest attempts to achieve interoperability between a variety of implementations. Potential changes include simplifying the content type to simply be "JSON", and adding OpenC2 version information and command IDs into the message content.  This may fold back into the definition of OpenC2 messages in the Language Specification.
